## Installing checkra1n (macOS)

1. Open checkra1n on your computer
1. Plug your iOS device into your computer

  - You may need to enable `enable untested versions` if you are on iOS 14.4 to {% include latestfw %} before being able to follow this step
  - Your device will be put into recovery mode automatically
1. You will now be presented with instructions in how to reboot your device into [DFU mode](faq#dfu_mode), click `Start` to begin
  - If you have an iPhone or iPad without a Home Button, follow [these instructions](troubleshooting#iphonex_dfu) to enter DFU mode, as the instructions in the checkra1n application are incorrect
